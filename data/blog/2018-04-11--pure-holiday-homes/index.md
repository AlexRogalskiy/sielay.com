## Story

The goal for fast-growing travel startup was to secure a stable team that can deliver. I was tasked to hire and build full operating software house in Poland and help manage it by the team in the UK. The team grew organically until the moment when the company was acquired. Most of the original team found a place in parent company afterwards.

Tasks consisted of:
 *  Recruitment (including hiring and firing)
 *  Operations
 *  Product design, architecture and delivery
 *  Other tasks that fit to VP of Engineering or Head of Technology role
