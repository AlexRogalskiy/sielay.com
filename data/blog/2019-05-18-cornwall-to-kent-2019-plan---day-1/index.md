I'll leave in the morning west, to the Lands End <sup>13m</sup> where I can have some nice
Cornish Pastry together with taking some pics. From there trip to Kent really starts.
On my way, I'll be able to see some bronze age monuments like Marry Maidens stone
cycle <sup>6m</sup>. While rolling back to Penzance I'd see Laylon Quoit and Men-an-Tol <sup>26m</sup> sites.
On either way in the town, I'd be able to do some small shopping or snack as there
is both Tesco Express and McDonald's.

I can stop a while after climbing Carn Marth hill <sup>49m</sup> and take a look at the views
and [amphitheatre](http://www.carnmarth.org.uk/) and magical lake on the hill. It would
be good to get supplies before to avoid the need to turn to any bigger town as most of
the route here will go via charing, but silent countryside.

Going downhill I'll arrive at river [Fal ferry](https://www.falriver.co.uk/getting-about/ferries/king-harry-ferry) <sup>58m</sup> landing  where I should be crossing its nice delta.
Crossing is just in front of National Trust Trelissick Garden, which is a charming
site on its own. There is only a small tourist shop there, so it's worth to have
some spare snack and water so far.

St. Austell <sup>77m</sup> would be a good place to restock and take a rest. There are plenty
of amenities in this picturesque town.  It would be a good moment for some wrap with
salad and a coffee. I won't be anyhow moving towards famous Eden Project site there,
as instead of artificial setups I'd prefer to enjoy another natural setting.

Another river on my way I'll cross with [Fower Bodnick Ferry](http://www.ctomsandson.co.uk/bodinnick-ferry/ferry-and-timetable/) <sup>84m</sup>. I'd be cycling over rolling hills and
valleys of small, but rapid rivers to turn for a while towards fantastic Talland Bay
Beach <sup>92m</sup> and back towards Looe.

Ten miles later <sup>95m</sup> I'll be crossing on the bridge in Looe. Except for the fairytale
landscape, this beautiful town provides quite a lot of amenities so will be a good place
to make small shopping and maybe a bigger meal.

My day will end in the [Maker Camp](https://makercamp.org.uk) <sup>110m</sup>. It's situated
on grounds of old military barracks and full of listed buildings, with amazing views
on the Channel and the harbours.
