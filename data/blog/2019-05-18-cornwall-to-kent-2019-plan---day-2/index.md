In the early morning, I'll use a [Cremyll Ferry](https://www.plymouthboattrips.co.uk/ferries/cremyll-ferry) <sup>2m</sup> leave Cornwall and enter Plymouth, Devon. To reach it I'd be
passing Mount Edgcumbe House with artificial (made in XVIII century) ruin on top of
the hill nearby. Plymouth is a massive town so I can buy water and snacks, but I
wouldn't stay there too long as big cities are always risky for bicycles even with
the best locks.

I'll enter Dartmoor National Park in Yelverton <sup>12m</sup>. Then plan a small break
in Princetown <sup>18m</sup> on the first peak this day. I'd pass through Postbridge
<sup>23m</sup> with stone clapper bridge and turn south towards monumental Haytor
<sup>33m</sup> to come back towards Moretonhampstead <sup>43m</sup>. There small
Co-Op should do for water and snack.

On 56th mile I'll be in Exeter. It would be good to take some break back there after
two massive and one middle climb this day. Especially there found medium ones ahead.
Exeter is quite a large town so there will be no problems with amenities. There is
a range of restaurant chains and sizable shopping centre just on my route.

In Honiton <sup>75m</sup> I'll prepare for another climb. I'll just briefly enter
the Blackdown Hills AONB to come back south towards Axminster <sup>86m</sup>. This
will be a good place for short rest and resupply before the last big climb that day.

I'll reach market town of Bridport at 101th mile. Having big Morrisons and just a
few miles left that would be bet time to pick some dinner and maybe a single use barbeque.

And finally in Wyke Regis <sup>119m</sup> I'll stay at
