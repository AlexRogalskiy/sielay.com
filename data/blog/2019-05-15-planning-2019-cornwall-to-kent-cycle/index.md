## What and why?

Another year, another challenge. After cycling 300 miles for University or Liverpool Pancreatic Cancer Research Fund in 2017 and walking over 50 miles for 11-year-old Szymon in 2018 I continue my journey by cycling 560 miles from Cornwall to Kent (and back to London).

While doing it I'll be [fundraising](https://www.justgiving.com/fundraising/cornwalltokent) for my local hospital children care units. The whole trip will be documented on Instagram and here. This article may also be updated a few times before the trip starts.

## Preparations

My bike will be tuned for a ride and is [fully insured](https://www.pedalsure.com/)
and registered in [BikeRegister](https://www.bikeregister.com/). I will have to
take proper locks of course and rain cover. I need still to decide if I'd take
paneer, but I may be fine with my large backpack. I will also take my small and
handy [Yellowstone Alpine 2](https://www.capitaloutdoors.co.uk/products/yellowstone-alpine-2-man-tent) tent.

Essentials like spare inner tubes, breaks blocks, first aid kit are obvious.

For the equipment, I'd have my two GoPro Session 4 cameras with
[extended 2000mAh batteries](https://www.amazon.co.uk/EcstaPro-Extended-Battery-Session-GP-KT5S/dp/B01MZE1OE1/) which should triple their use time. I'd use them more to document
the trip than as dashcam.

Food and water are essential, but I learned that it's best to have just around
1 litre of water (one in a holder and one in the backpack) and some muesli or
chocolate bars. For the rest having some Tesco Extra and McDonalds on the route
works best and value for money and convenience. Bars, pubs and restaurants are
too expensive - so I'd use them only for a kind meal, but except dinner on such
a trip, you can't eat too much at once.

## Trip overview

### Depature

I will leave the office earlier on 31st July to get to London Paddington station
and from there take a train (£38) to Penzance. I'd arrive there around 23:00 and
stay at [Ponsandane](http://www.ponsandane.co.uk/) camping site (£7.00).

I'll leave in the morning west, to the Lands End (10m) where I can have some nice Cornish Pastry together with taking some pics. From there trip to Kent really starts.
