I'll wake up with the view on Fleet, long sandy beach slit from the land with
a shallow canal on one side and Isle of Portland on the other. Best would be
to roll to Weymouth <sup>3m</sup> for breakfast and water.

From there I'll roll over the hills with a view on Studland to Portland Special Area of Conservation coast to reach picturesque ruins of Corfe Castle <sup>25m</sup>.

One climb later I'll be able to enter Bournemouth <sup>37m</sup> via ferry at
Shell Bay Terminal. That will be totally different, new surrounding. Instead of
raw nature, I'll roll along with the popular resort crowded beaches.

I'll briefly pass Christchurch <sup>43m</sup> and enter my beloved New Forest
National Park. Place with unspoiled nature and wild horses.

Behind that green Eden, next will be a concrete jungle of Southampton <sup>68m</sup>.
Good place and time to stop by and greet with friends who hosted me two years ago
on the previous challenge and grab some snack before last straight this day.

After killer hills of Portsmouth <sup>84m</sup>, I'll stop in Chichester
<sup>97m</sup> for final, diner supplu and head towards next camping.

This night I'd spend on the most pricy place so far, but very flexible. I found
a few cheaper in the area, but all of them were closing very early and I wanted
to be sure they'll let me in. [Red House Farm](https://www.rhfcamping.co.uk/)
<sup>103m</sup>.
