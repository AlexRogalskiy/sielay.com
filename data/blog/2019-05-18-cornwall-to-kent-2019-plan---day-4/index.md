From Chichester, I'll move towards the popular resort of Bognor Regis
<sup>10m</sup>. That should be last stop for some snack and water as next over
30 miles will be flat roll alongside the beach.

On 38th mile I'll reach Brighton which is nice, but I don't want to stay there
longer. It will be crowded and busy. I prefer long route under the cliff via
Rottingdean <sup>42m</sup> where I found a nice cafe last year, all way to Seaford
<sup>51m</sup> where I'll stop before climbing Seven Sisters. Actually, the best
place to stop there would be McDonald's just behind Newheaven <sup>47m</sup> as
 Seaford doens't have too many amenities and the road from there is flat and smootch.

Before reaching Eastbourne <sup>61m</sup> I'll pass Birling Gap which is popular
photo and rest spot and Belle Tout Lighthouse hotel.

As Eastbourne is nice and properly supplied town it would make far more sense to
make next stop in Hastings <sup>78m</sup> as it will welcome us with yet another
(not the last) climb this day.

Nice place for a brief stop would be Rye <sup>92m</sup> which is super popular
among Instagramers.

I'll pass sleepy areas of Lydd <sup>99m</sup> to reach Folkestone <sup>120m</sup>.
Again this will mean buying some dinner and rolling towards the campsite.

Last sleep on that route will be at
[Little Satmar](https://www.keatfarm.co.uk/camping-folkestone/little-satmar-campsite)
<sup>123.55m</sup>.
A lovely little place with views of next day approach to Dover Cliffs.
