I'll roll over 400 feet down to Dover <sup>5m</sup> just to climb again 400 and
roll same down again. From there it will be flat all they way.

Sensible next stops would be Withstable <sup>52m</sup> and Datford <sup>98m</sup>,

I should reach Wimbledon <sup>121m</sup> late evening, probably I'll think more
about warm bath than any bigger dinner and fall asleep with a cat by my side.
