## Story

Having already built web & desktop [Pushfor app](/blog/2018/04/11/pushfor/) in the next step we wanted to reuse same 
technology to address wider use case and audience. Having clear guidelines from our product team we picked an ambitious
 project of buidling public content delivery protocol. This time main focus was on our team (web) as this use case 
 doesn't base as much on native client implementations.

The Push2link client is part of PushFor web platform, in full-stack, stateless form. It communicates to API to 
determine the availability of the linked resource, then presents it and reports back analytics data.
