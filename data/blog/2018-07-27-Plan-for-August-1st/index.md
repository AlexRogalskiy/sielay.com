[Aug 1st](https://www.strava.com/routes/14502212) 27.5m.

I'll leave from East Croydon Station at 6:49AM and will arrive to Brighton 7:44AM. Cost
via [TrainLine](https://trainline.com) was just about &pound;16 compared to average 32.

After reaching the cliff I'll go towards Rottingdean, Peacehaven and finally Newhaven
at the 10th mile. That should be good moment to take a break and maybe eat something
more solid. Newhaven is small, but nice habour town so should have no problem with
an affordable shopping.

In Seaford I'll start climbing cliffs at mile 14, but that will be very light until
turning bit north to cross the river in Exceat and starting waling Seven Sisters.
For that trip I'd have to grab bigger supply in Seaford or Newhaven for sure as
it will be long walk in the wild until final big climb at 25th mile and walking
down to hostel at 27th mile where I'd just take a shower and pass.

Supply for a trip:

 * Water
 * Chocolate
 * Apples
 * Some bun with some heat resistant filling

Staying at [YHA Eastbourne Hostel](http://www.booking.com/Share-J0zPvv) &pound; 17.
