Recently got on timeline nice short article saying that IT industry in the UK is booming. I think that is true. I can see that each day in my mailbox and on my phone. As a senior (hope not because of age) I experience a bit hard to manage flood of various offers. It's nice feeling to be recognised by recruiters. But it's annoying that still many of them don't even try to walk just for a moment in my shoes. If they were, they would figure out why I reject some of their enquiries in a seconds:

 1. **I work full time**. What does that mean? Especially senior developers, architects and managers have quite hectic days at work. Also their work require proper focus and time management. If you try to call me five times in a row during working hours, don't be surprised your number is being blocked.
 1. **I won't just stand up and walk away**. If I work full time and you send me offer that require start ASAP (meaning couple of days), then it's unlikely I can pick it. Always assume at least 2 weeks notice period in case of experienced workers. Safer one month.
 1. **Read and understand**. If I get information that head hunter have read my CV or LinkedIn profile and send me jobs that contain requirements not covering my speciality, I automatically ignore them. It's waste of my and employer's time. I did Android, it doesn't mean I do iOS. If you don't find that technology on my profile, means I don't do that. You have .NET job that require 3+ years experience. If you don't see in my last 3 years any project in .NET, I am not the person.
 1. **Give me a reason**. If you want to pull me from current project, you need to convince me. Most of senior workers don't look actively for a job. But they consider change. Once they want to move, it's often too late for you to help, as it doesn't take long for them to find something. If you write that salary will be competitive, you ask to drive 2 hours each day, give dry list of requirements - it's unlikely anyone would pick such offer.
 1. **You won't own me**. Many head hunters come without any precise offer and try to grab a contact, chat over, pull as much info they can before they give any possible result. I work full time, I have no time to talk about product which isn't there. You won't make me stick only to you and ignore other head hunters.

I don't want to sound too aggressive, but that are clear facts of very commonly made mistakes by head hunters. I do appreciate recruiters work and keep good relations with some. Anyhow often (in many office jobs nova days in the UK) people learn some easy formulas and don't think on what they are doing. It may work when looking for unexperienced workers. If you look for the best ones, you need to the best one. Otherwise other recruiters will defeat you.

About me: I am over 13 years in IT industry. I started as a home-grown developer, evolved to a senior engineer, architect, manager and startup team assembler. I try to combine economical education and knowledge collected over the years to help entrepreneurs reach their goals. My observations are based on experience of myself, my colleagues and business partners. Many non-IT learnings are lessons given by my mentors, bosses and investors basing on their own failures, successes and learnings. Every project I join benefits from it and I hope you can benefit too.
