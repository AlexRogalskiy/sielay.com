 * cheap and fast, but it will be a crap.
 * something in the middle (optimum)

When you try to show that to the business often answer is that they need FAST, CHEAP and GOOD at once. It's a pattern and everlasting conflict between production and executives in modern companies.

No matter how you turn it around still you will be in the same situation. When your status will be same close to each three extremums it will never be cheap, good or fast.

But! Remember. According to many GEOMETRY is something that we can push off by simple:
