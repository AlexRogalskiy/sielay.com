We grew from one individual to a team of 10 and remained very happy with the quality of work delivered and the cost savings compared to recruiting and managing a team in the UK. Communication and attention to detail were always of the highest standard and they are highly commercial in their thinking and practise, in particular looking for the most effective solutions to problems not just the east quick win. We were so impressed with the team that we used them to build an outsources customer service team of 4 that substantially improved our capacity and customer satisfaction. I would highly recommend a working partnership with Sielay.",
