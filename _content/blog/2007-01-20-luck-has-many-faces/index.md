Luck have many faces. I may say I’m very happy and lucky, or am I not? I have much of experience that gave me a chance to find great job. I have wonderful team to work with and party with (see latest photos in gallery). I have loving family and friends that really are supporting me. I have really great plans for future as you can see in notes below. But is that make me happy person? I hope so. I don’t want to think that there is something that can make me unsuccessful. But still. There are things that can make me sad… Did I missed something? Did I lost anything? Do I regret? No. I would never regret any single part of my life… Even if I know that missing this time would kill me… Remember, never regret anything… Even if that means suffer… That’s the only way to happiness.
