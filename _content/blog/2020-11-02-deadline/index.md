Week or so ago Svetlana Tikhanovskaya gave an ultimatum to the regime. For the last few weeks, people walk out on the streets of Poland. The United Kingdom is torn and terrified of a new lockdown starting on Thursday. Next
few days will show if the USA will be normal again or fall into an authoritarian abyss. It seems that 2020 gives us a deadline between getting normality and an Armageddon.

Let's just hope that Joe Biden will win and try to glue the US together. That UK will understand it needs the EU to sort out the economy and defend it from the virus backslash. That Poland will defy totalitarian ambitions
of Kaczy≈Ñski and return political plurality and human rights. And that Lukashenko would vanish with his minions. Forever.
