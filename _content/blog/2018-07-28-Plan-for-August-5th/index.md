[Aug 5th](https://www.strava.com/routes/14502561) 27.5m.

First 4 miles down to Deal and then flat.

May grab a sandwitch in Sandwitch at mile 12, before going to Ramsgate (19),
Broadstairs (22) and finally Margate at (27.5).

Will leave 21:53 from Margate to London St. Pancras where will have nice Northern Line
tube back to Wimbledon. Timing should be fine, but just in case that day will have to start much ealier.

And that will be over 5 marathons in 5 days.
