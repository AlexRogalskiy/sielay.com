[Aug 3rd](https://www.strava.com/routes/14502513) 28.7 mile.

After initial hilly 7 miles rest of that will be flat and I'd walk to marshes
around Lydd.

Rya at mile 10 and Lydd 20 will be only proper places for shopping before new
Romney at 27. It should be easy day for elevation, but also requiring fast pace because
of the distance.

Staying at [Marlie Holiday Park](https://www.pitchup.com/campsites/England/South_East/Kent/New_Romney/marlie-holiday-park/) &pound;24.
