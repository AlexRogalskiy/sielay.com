In the beginning, over here was a blog. Teenage, developer-plus-anyone wannabe blog. It turned to portfolio-showoff. Then I-want-to-look-serious business site. Then nothing. For one-month random porn site. And as I turned full self-discovery circle it’s blog again.

I think you need to make mistakes to learn something. And the same is with it - my nickname, my site, my brand. It went very high and felt very low. Just to come back where it should be in the first place.

So why I come back to blogging, again? What do I want to achieve?

I do it for myself. To address few challenges I need to confront.

-   improve my communication to be more clear and to the point,
-   discuss my findings and learnings in areas I am actually strong, and stop fussing with opinions about things I know nothing about,
-   learn to filter what is shareable and what shouldn’t
-   fight my social media addiction by channelling my feedback to one, organised medium
-   enforce routine and rhythm in life, work and self-improvement.

To do that I’m going to keep writing, at least once a week following few simple rules:

-   I’ll write in English, as despite it not being my native tongue or language used at home, it’s most important in my daily and professional communication,
-   I’ll write about findings, results, tests, experiences, instead of free opinions without argumentation,
-   I’ll write about single topic at once, keeping structure similar to essay with clear point, explanation and conclusion,
-   I’ll write about various, but first-hand topics such as software development (more from an engineering point of view, rather than the business site), fighting own overweight, learning parenting skills, hobbies like cycling or small travels; own lifestyle hacks.

I will grow it organically instead of shouting first on my social accounts, so you may discover it after a while. I am not sure if I’d re-enable comments just yet. As it may be counterintuitive when fighting my social media addiction. Anyhow, I hope you’ll enjoy it.
