Being honest - again it’s too late to write more than few words. So I’ll just write briefly about what happened last days. Every other additional info, I’ll provide in next note… or next… or next.

So… I was with my princess on some kind of hip-hop battle of Szczecin. Funny thing. Something similar to that what you could see in 8th mile. Again, i knew nothing about what was there going on. I just believed my gf that some of MCs were OK, or other sucks. But I can say, except that some parts of it were a bit boring, I spent this weekend very nice. I think that’s because her - but that’s obvious, I think. So… Now I’m going sleep. Tomorrow, after gym, before job and during breakfast I’ll try to write a bit more.
