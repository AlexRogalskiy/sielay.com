Advertisements for a long time isn't simple topic anymore. It's not just putting one square on your page and hoping for some money to come back. You have to consider multiple factors like:

 * how visible ad slots are to visitors
 * how long visitors see ads
 * are ads frustrating users (cause bounce backs)
 * are ads affecting website performance
 * are ads relevant to content
 * is website performance affecting ads revenue
 * are ads engaging
 * which slots perform better
 * how user behaviour affect which slots are mostly viewed

Without covering those grounds you can't really talk to serious clients and use benefits of selling campaigns directly. To solve that large companies are hiring army of workers who face that challenge on daily basis. But what, if you are not a Goliath? Can you afford hire multiple developers to add and modify slots, adOps for time for reporting rather than setting up creatives, pay third party companies for each fancy ad format they invent?

Just think about it.

While you will consider your situation take a look on video showing our latest product which we rolled out for early adapters. You can cover all mentioned above in one place, without all overheads - for fraction of original cost. Wouldn't that be better?
