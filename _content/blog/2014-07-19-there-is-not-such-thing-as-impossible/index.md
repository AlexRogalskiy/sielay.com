All my life I was focused on helping others to achieve their goals with my skills, knowledge and experience. That focus anyhow never made me stop to try achieve something myself. It placed me in very comfortable situation to see breaking points, rises and failures that built my believe in victory, even in David vs Goliat war. Just a couple of them:

 * **Even the big ones lose their chances:** Years ago I worked in cutting edge technology team that explored ways to use mobile technologies. Project has such a big support in organisation that could push anything worldwide in days and float the market. There was idea about functionality to allow people to use their geolocation to share information about being in cool places. It was pushed back by legal department as legally risky. Shortly after LinkedIn won the market. They weren't afraid to try.
 * **No ideas are unique, unique are actions:** In one of our projects we had problem with planning holidays. We wrote small app to organise them, but because lack of time it was never ended. It was considered to be supported by investor, but was judged as unsellable. Later similar project was picked by my students, but left likely because lack of confidence. Now on market I see couple of success stories around solving same issue. Today I found third one [wheniwork.com](http://wheniwork.com/). Looks interesting.
 * **But David can beat Goliat:** One recent meeting of Marlow Entreprenours (great local event in my area), I had a chance to listen to story of incredible person - Will King vel. King of Shaves ([nice article here](http://www.director.co.uk/MAGAZINE/2014/03-March-2014/Cover%20story_67_06.html)) - who started a fight with world biggest brands (of toiletries, so hardware not software!) and by ignoring risks and strong going forward, he won some tasty parts of this precious cake.
 * **Being in LA, NY or London make it easier, being elsewhere doesn't make it impossible:** We hear all the time about great success stories from USA, sometimes from the UK. Ok, that are IT tech hubs. Most of money is there, talents are there, scene is there. But hard work can change rules of game. You can check story of [Red Sky](http://www.red-sky.com/), founders of filestube.com or shorte.st (both very hot now). This all was founded by two years younger than me, who had just one goal in head - make something big. I don't know anyone with bigger focus on the goal. You can check also companies like [Wargaming.net](http://eu.wargaming.net/) or [MapsWithMe](http://mapswith.me/en/home), which made awesome job in their areas and both are from Minsk, Belarus (how many of you know here Belarus is?).
 * **Chances can fall from the sky, be ready to use them:* While improving my skills in ActionScript for one of my clients, I made silly game themed in local happenings on political scene in my country. Game day after pushing to my friend on facebook was linked by all major media in the country (what killed my server). It was great success, but as I wasn't expert in gaming or PR field I wasn't ready to use it. I used it to gain few other deals, but nothing same amazing. So far name of it is often used as idiom in some political commentaries (Funny doe few years later we have run with friends action to change some legal acts in Poland, and even we weren't successful we managed to put in use another idiom... it seems to be one of the easiest things ;)).

All these examples ensure me that it's always worth trying. Even if you have little time, even you have no ideas. Sometimes by just learning you can find something that will change rules of the game. Sometimes tomorrow you can be the next big thing. Hope it helps your motivation too.
