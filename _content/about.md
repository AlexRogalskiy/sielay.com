Hi, my name is Łukasz (pronounced [ˈwukaʂ]). Originally from Szczecin, Poland. Now living in Wimbledon, London, United Kingdom. I’m a father, husband, software developer, team lead, aspiring enreprenour and amatour cyclist. I started with web early. I kept failing and reinventing myself. Now I start over, simpler, without too much stress.
